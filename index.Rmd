## Filtering Rows and Columns

With SQL, you can filter columns with SELECT and ROWS with WHERE. Let's look at an example using the Lahman baseball database. First we need to load some packages

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library (Lahman)
library (sqldf)
```
suppose we want to see homerun totals for the 1927 Yankees we could write...

```{r}
query<- "SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)

```
